# Full ICP Search for Cursor, Claude Code and Grok Bot

<img src="assets/logo.png" width="64" height="64" alt="Full ICP Search logo">

Find and size your ideal customer profile from 1B+ professional profiles and 115M
companies, then pull B2B leads with live emails, verified mobile numbers, decision makers
by company domain, company lists with funding and hiring signals. Your agent counts a
segment for free first, then pays per row found through your Apify account.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `people-database-search` | people by title, seniority, employer, size, industry, past employer, tenure; free counts and market breakdowns |
| `b2b-leads-finder` | people with a live email on every row; paste an Apollo search URL if you have one |
| `company-database-search` | 115M companies by country, industry, HQ, founding year, headcount, last funding round |
| `domain-to-decision-makers` | founders, C-level, VPs and directors at any domain, with the email that reaches them |
| `work-email-finder` | a work address from a name and a domain, with deliverability evidence |
| `linkedin-email-finder` | the email on record for a list of profile URLs |
| `linkedin-to-phone` | verified mobile numbers for a list of profile URLs (mostly US) |
| `linkedin-job-search-api` | 50M+ job postings as hiring signals; free preview with breakdowns |
| `call-actor` | the other 27 [Actors](https://apify.com/b2bsearch) by id: company employees, reverse email lookup, phones by email or by name, new hires, lookalike companies, bulk enrichment, hiring companies |

Seven skills teach the agent the method: size first, cap the spend, keep lists clean,
report what was skipped. See [skills/](skills/).

Pricing is per row delivered, printed in each tool's description (people rows from
$0.95 per 1,000, leads with emails from $1.50 per 1,000, decision makers $3.20 per
1,000). Nothing is charged per search; counts and previews are free. On the Free Apify
plan each Actor gives an account 500 rows a month and up to 100 rows per run; the
people and leads searches return up to 25 rows per run when an agent starts them.
Any paid Apify plan lifts these limits.

## Install

### Grok Bot

- **Prospecting Desk template.** A ready bot on the official Apify plugin: free market
  sizing, lead lists, decision makers, hiring signals, weekly routines. Paste
  [grok-bot/prospecting-desk.txt](grok-bot/prospecting-desk.txt) as the first message to a
  new bot, then add the Apify plugin (**Settings → Plugins → Apify → Add**).
- **Custom MCP server.** Ask your bot to add it; the exact prompt is in
  [docs/grok-bot.md](docs/grok-bot.md).

### Cursor

One click, the MCP server only:

[![Add Full ICP Search to Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=full-icp-search&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5hcGlmeS5jb20vP3Rvb2xzPWNhbGwtYWN0b3IsZmV0Y2gtYWN0b3ItZGV0YWlscyxiMmJzZWFyY2gvcGVvcGxlLWRhdGFiYXNlLXNlYXJjaCxiMmJzZWFyY2gvYjJiLWxlYWRzLWZpbmRlcixiMmJzZWFyY2gvY29tcGFueS1kYXRhYmFzZS1zZWFyY2gsYjJic2VhcmNoL2RvbWFpbi10by1kZWNpc2lvbi1tYWtlcnMsYjJic2VhcmNoL3dvcmstZW1haWwtZmluZGVyLGIyYnNlYXJjaC9saW5rZWRpbi1qb2Itc2VhcmNoLWFwaSxiMmJzZWFyY2gvbGlua2VkaW4tZW1haWwtZmluZGVyLGIyYnNlYXJjaC9saW5rZWRpbi10by1waG9uZSZjbGllbnQ9ZnVsbC1pY3Atc2VhcmNoIn0=)

With the skills: import this repository as a team marketplace
(**Dashboard → Plugins & MCPs → Add Marketplace → Import from Repo**), or copy the
folder to `~/.cursor/plugins/local/full-icp-search` and reload the window. Connect the
`full-icp-search` MCP server when Cursor asks; the browser opens the Apify sign-in.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add b2bsearch/full-icp-search
claude plugin install full-icp-search@full-icp-search
```

Run `/mcp` to sign in to the `full-icp-search` server.

### Any other MCP client

The server is Apify's hosted MCP with these tools pre-selected:

```
https://mcp.apify.com/?tools=call-actor,fetch-actor-details,b2bsearch/people-database-search,b2bsearch/b2b-leads-finder,b2bsearch/company-database-search,b2bsearch/domain-to-decision-makers,b2bsearch/work-email-finder,b2bsearch/linkedin-job-search-api,b2bsearch/linkedin-email-finder,b2bsearch/linkedin-to-phone
```

Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration; an `Authorization:
Bearer <apify token>` header works where OAuth is not available.

## Try it

- "How many heads of sales work at Dutch companies with 50 to 500 employees?" (free)
- "Pull 50 of them with emails."
- "Who runs marketing at linear.app, vercel.com and supabase.com?"
- "Which US companies are hiring SDRs this month, and who is their VP of Sales?"
- "Here are 40 profile URLs from our event list. Get their work emails and, for the US ones, mobile numbers."
- "Who is behind sales@ and jane@ on this signup list, and where do they work?"

## Testing

Locally: point any MCP client at the server URL above, sign in, call
`b2bsearch--people-database-search` with `mode: "count"` and a title; a count comes back
in under ten seconds and costs nothing.

In-app: install the plugin, connect the MCP server, ask one of the prompts above.

## Data and rules

The data is a licensed professional-profile and company database; every row carries
the date its record was last refreshed. The plugin is for B2B research and
outbound. It is not for recruiting, consumer lists or looking up private individuals,
and the skills say so to the agent.
